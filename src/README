Build Instructions
------------------

Type "make dist" to build and copy the C++ and JAR files into
the ../jsimple directory.

SWIG compatibility: 3.x and 4.x (versions 3.0.12 and 4.0.2 were tested).

If you have SWIG 4.x, add SWIG=swig -doxygen to the Makefile to let SWIG
transfer the C++ documentation comments into the generated Java sources.
SWIG 4.0.2 has some problem with stray "<" signs in the comments (it exits
with an error); you can fix those by escaping "<" with backslash.
